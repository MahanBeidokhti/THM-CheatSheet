# Welcome

## what is this ?

well, hello!\
i was doing a bootcamp with the site [TryHackMe](https://www.tryhackme.com) and there was lots of commands and tips that i wanted to note and i think, that would be great if i write this cheatsheet on my github so everyone can use it :D \
and thank you for reading and i would be so happy if you have any idea or hint for me to improve this book.

i hope you enjoy it ;)
